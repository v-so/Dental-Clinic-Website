# Dental-Clinic-Website

Team project for course COMP-353. Involved creating a front-end, back-end for a company that owns a network of dental clinics where we 
designed a database for a company that owns a network of dental clinics. Formulated and evaluated various SQL queries against an instance 
of the database (MySQL). It provided an interface to the database and integrated the queries in it. Allowed users (patients) to make appointments, 
allowed dentists to assign appointments, produce bills to record treatment costs.
